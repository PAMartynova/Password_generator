#Password Generator
This is a Django-based web application that allows you to easily create, store, and manage your passwords.

With the Password Manager, you can:

- Log in to your account
- Generate passwords of a specified length and with specific symbols
- Save generated passwords to your account with a title
- View all of your saved passwords

All of your saved passwords are stored in an encrypted form using AES encryption to keep your data secure.
